  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      Born in 2000 in Germany, using Linux since 2015 and started with IT-Security in 2016. I am a Cloud and Kubernetes Security Engineer and finished my Bachelor of Science in IT-Security at the Ruhr-University Bochum.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      As an engineer I focus on security and like to work on complex problems. I do what I love and always try to optimize my work. Passing on my knowledge in the form of various talks, workshops or trainings is one of my passions. Mostly it's about Kubernetes and cloud security. All slides are published on Github in my talk repo.
      <br>
      Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. I try to see the world and get my own picture of different things. When traveling I like to go hiking or rest on the beach.
